# Brewdog Beers Project

------------------
This is my Brewdog API project, coded using React and SCSS, pulling information from the Brewdog API to create a user friendly search engine of Brewdog's many offerings.
------------------


## Capabilities/usage instructions
A user can use the search bar to type in a beer by name, and the site will filter out anything that does not include this search term. It is case insensitive so it doesn't matter which case a user types in.

A user can use one of 3 filters or a combination of all 3 to filter the beers by predetermined standards.

## Limitations
The API only pulls the top 80 beers so it does not include all the available data from the API

## It looks like this:
